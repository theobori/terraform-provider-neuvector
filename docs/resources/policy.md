# neuvector_policy (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "neuvector_policy" "test" {
  rule {
    action       = "deny"
    applications = ["any"]
    comment      = "Containers constraints"
    disable      = false
    from         = "containers"
    to           = "containers"
    learned      = false
    ports        = "any"
    priority     = 0
  }

  rule {
    policy_id    = 123
    action       = "deny"
    applications = ["HTTP", "Redis"]
    comment      = "Nodes web constraints"
    from         = "nodes"
    to           = "containers"
    ports        = "tcp/80"
  }

    to           = "nodes"
    ports        = "tcp/80"
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

### Optional

- `rules_scope` (String) Scope applied to every rules, it helps definin the url.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `policy_ids` (Set of Number) Contains every policy ID including the dynamic ones.

<a id="nestedblock--rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule`

Required:

- `action` (String) Action when this policy is triggered.
- `applications` (List of String) Enter applications for NeuVector to allow or deny. NeuVector understands deep application behavior and will analyze the payload to determine application protocols. Protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, SSH, DNS, DNCP, NTP, TFTP, ECHO, RTSP, SIP, MySQL, Redis, Zookeeper, Cassandra, MongoDB, PostgresSQL, Kafka, Couchbase, ActiveMQ, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, Radius, VoltDB, Consul, Syslog, Etcd, Spark, Apache, Nginx, Jetty, NodeJS, Oracle, MSSQL, Memcached and gRPC. To select everything enter "any"
- `from` (String) Specify the group from where the connection will originate.
- `ports` (String) If there are specific ports to limit this rule to, enter them here. For ICMP traffic, enter icmp. Sample: 80,tcp/8080,udp/6142-6150,tcp/any,udp/any,icmp,any
- `to` (String) Specify the destination GROUP where these connections are allowed or denied.

Optional:

- `cfg_type` (String) The type of configuration, its scope, for example whether the rule applies to the whole federation or just to the cluster.
- `comment` (String) A comment from the user.
- `disable` (Boolean) Disable the policy.
- `learned` (Boolean) Indicates if the rules has been learned.
- `policy_id` (Number) Dont use this field if you want to generate a new ID.
- `priority` (Number) The rule priority level.

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import neuvector_policy.name {{policy_id}}
```
